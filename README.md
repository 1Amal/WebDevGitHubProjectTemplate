Getting Started
Clone this repository:

## Initial Setup
When creating a new project use Github templates and choose this template to create a repo with this template

Install all dependencies at once:
`npm install css-loader eslint webpack html-webpack-plugin prettier eslint-config-prettier --save-dev`

Install dependencies individually
`npm install css-loader --save-dev`
`npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev`
`npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev`
`npm install prettier --save-dev`
`npm install eslint-config-prettier --save-dev`
`npm install eslint --save-dev`





## Automatically deploy to Github Pages

## Automatic build
npx webpack --watch

## Project Structure
This template includes the following folders and files:

src: Contains the source code for your web application.
components: Reusable UI components.
styles: Stylesheets for your application (e.g., CSS, SCSS).
assets: Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
index.js: The main entry point for your JavaScript application.
index.html: The main HTML template for your application.
Additional folders can be added based on your project needs (e.g., utils, api).
public: (Optional) This folder can be used for serving static assets directly by the development server.
package.json: Manages project dependencies and scripts.
webpack.config.js: Webpack configuration file for bundling JavaScript modules.
.eslintrc.js: ESLint configuration file for linting rules.
.prettierrc.js: Prettier configuration file for formatting rules.
Note: The public folder is not strictly required but can be helpful during development with a development server.


ESLint: During development, consider running ESLint automatically on file changes to catch errors and style inconsistencies early on. You can integrate it with your development server or use a linting tool like ESLint CLI.
Prettier: Prettier can be configured to format your code automatically on save or using a script. This ensures consistent code style throughout your project.
Building for Production
The specific steps for building a production-ready version of your application may vary depending on your chosen tools and hosting platform. Generally, you'll want to:

Run a build script (often defined in package.json) to:
Bundle JavaScript modules using Webpack.
Minify the code (optional) for smaller file sizes.
Optimize assets (optional) for faster loading.
Follow the deployment instructions for your chosen hosting platform.
Remember: This is a comprehensive template. Feel free to customize it further based on your specific needs! Consider adding additional linters or formatters depending on your preferences.
